This project was a task assigned by the company 

To use spotify api we have to do certains task :

1.We have to first request for access token to fetch api data for that we have to send request with our client id and clinet secret
both generated on the spotify developer website.

2.After we got access token we now can request for api data .

3.Now,we made request for the data for the partiular name we searched on the search bar to display the result on the screen .

4.Once we get the response of our request . We made the last call of request to fetch the data of first item of our result .

5. After that we stored the responses using useState hook .

6. Lastly, we display the data using map function and thats it.
